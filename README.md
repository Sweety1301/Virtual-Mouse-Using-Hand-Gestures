# Virtual-Mouse-Using-Hand-Gestures

The Virtual Mouse Detection project aims to develop a system that allows users to control the mouse pointer through hand gestures using computer vision techniques. This project utilizes a webcam to track hand movements and detect specific gestures to simulate mouse actions such as moving the cursor, left-clicking, right-clicking, double-clicking.

Objective

The main objective is to implement a computer vision-based virtual mouse system using Python, OpenCV, Mediapipe, and PyAutoGUI that can:
●	Track hand gestures.

●	Translate these gestures into mouse actions.

●	Perform actions like left-click, right-click, double-click.
